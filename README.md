## CV method

Building a representative CV was one of the most challenging tasks in this competition, especially after the leak. We tried many CV approaches and most of them gave us too optimistic AUC scores.

## Reproduce the solution


# Install
Using Jupyter docker image to not deal with installing dependencies on your machine.
Just install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), then run `docker-compose up` and you're all set :)

The notebook will be exposed on your local machine at port `8888`.


The code corresponding to each group of model is available in separate folders.
The solution can be reproduced in three steps :

* 1 : place the data in the `data` folder
* 2 : xxx
* 3 : xxx
